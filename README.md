I developed a real-time chat application that allows users to communicate easily in various chat rooms. Users can join rooms, send messages, and chat with others instantly.

Steps to Run the Application:
Create New Users: Start by creating new user accounts. You need to provide the username and password in the payload.
Create New Rooms: Next, set up new chat rooms. The room_name must be included in the payload and should be unique.

Connection Instructions:
Connect to ws://localhost:3000.

Client-Side Instructions:
Listen for the message event, which the server uses to send messages.
Use the joinRoom event, providing the room_name as payload in the request and including the username in the headers. Note that you wonâ€™t be able to join the room if either the username or room name does not exist.
Once connected to the room, you can send messages using the chatMessage event.
